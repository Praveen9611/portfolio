                <p>
                    I am a fourth-year undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
                    <a href="https://www.mriet.ac.in/" class="about-link">Malla Reddy Institute of Engineering And Technology</a>. 
                    I was born in Hyderabad, Telangana.

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m passionate about outdoor activities, especially playing volleyball and cricket. These sports not only keep me active but also strengthen my team collaboration, strategic thinking, and leadership skills—qualities that directly translate into my professional growth in the tech world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Music is another love of mine, particularly melody songs, which fuel my creativity and help me maintain focus. This blend of technical curiosity and creative energy drives me to explore innovative solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently, I developed "Factflow", an interactive blog website where I share fascinating facts about science, nature, and technology. This project reflects my commitment to learning, sharing knowledge, and continuously evolving in the digital space.
                </p>
    
                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    On my way, I have learned a range of programming languages such as C and Python. I have also developed some Python-based Graphical User Interfaces (links can be found in the Portfolio section).
